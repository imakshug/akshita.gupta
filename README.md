# MY Portfolio

##Hi, Welcome to my portfolio! 
I’m Akshita, a computer science undergrad with a passion for technology and creativity. and I’m excited to share my work with you. I’ve gained valuable experience through my internship at Infosys and had the opportunity to be selected as a mentee for Stanford University’s Code in Place program. I also served as a delegate for the HPAIR (Harvard College Project for Asian and International Relations) conference.

I’ve been actively involved with GDG Cloud Bhopal, where I’ve organized major tech events, including Cloud Community Day Bhopal. With my overactive imagination, I have a deep love for books, art, and music.
